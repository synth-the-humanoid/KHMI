Work in Progress Modding API for Kingdom Hearts Final Mix. Built to be version-independent, however currently only supports EPIC version 1.0.0.9. New offsets will be added to KHMI/offsets.csv as they are found.

Prebuilt files are in LatestRelease. You only need either ModManager or ModManagerCLI. Currently, only ModManagerCLI supports command-line messages, so mods that use this feature heavily should ask users to use that version.

After downloading the folder for whichever version you'd like, run the .exe file in that folder. Start Kingdom Hearts Final Mix and link the program with the game for the first time. After this, you can disconnect by following the instructions on-screen for whichever version you have acquired and you'll notice that a "mods" folder exists in the same folder the .exe file is in. This is where you will place any .dll mod files you come across.
